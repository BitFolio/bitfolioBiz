ABOUT DAVID ANDERSON
 

My background is in systems and software engineering. I am a technology buff, and I enjoy getting in early on technology that will impact the future. I started bitfolio.biz in 2014 to document my crypto adventure. In 2013, I started mining crypto with ASIC mining rigs (or dedicated mining hardware). In 2016 and 2017, I was trading Bitcoin on Huobi, when trades were free. So, I have been mining, trading and investing in digital assets for nine years, and I am ready and willing to share my knowledge and expertise with you.

I have been a self-directed investor for over 20 years. But, 2020 was a pivotal year for me. I got divorced, and lost half of everything that the owned. Determined to make back all that I had lost, I bought the dip in April of 2020. Since April of 2020, my returns have been 10x and 30x on my key crypto assets.

In early 2021, I went all in on crypto assets. I exited the stock market, and converted all my retirement accounts and investment accounts to BTC (⅔) and ETH (⅓). Since then, ETH has doubled while BTC has held its value. 

In 2022, I started doing crypto coaching, teaching crypto courses and launching crypto-investing-support groups. I am not a registered investment advisor. Even so, I support anyone who has a dream to secure their financial future by investing in crypto assets. As a crypto coach, I help people to invest in digital assets without undue risks or long time horizons.

I have been working full-time in the Blockchain industry since 2019 as a systems engineer, software engineer and platform architect. In 2021, I became a certified Blockchain Solution Architect.
